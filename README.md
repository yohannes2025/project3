# ULTIMATE Battleships
Battleships, also known simply as Battleship, is a classic two-player strategy game that blends deduction, tactics, and a touch of luck. Originating as a pencil-and-paper game during World War I, it has since evolved into a popular board game, digital adaptation, and mobile app enjoyed by players of all ages worldwide.

## Game Overview

In this Battleships, the player commands a fleet of ships strategically placed on a grid. The objective is to locate and "sink" the opponent’s fleet, in this case, the computer by guessing it's ships positions through a series of targeted strikes. The game involves strategic thinking as player must conceal his/her ships placement while trying to discover and destroy his/her opponent’s.

## Why should you play the battleship game?
Battleships is more than just a game-it's a test of strategy, anticipation, and patience. Its simplicity makes it accessible, while its depth keeps players coming back for more. Whether played on paper, a game board, or digitally, it remains an enduring favorite in family game nights and competitive play.

Are you ready to command your fleet and outmaneuver your opponent? Let the battle begin!

## Development

Welcome to the Ultimate Battleships Game! This is a console-based implementation of the classic game of Battleship where a player competes against a computer opponent. The game involves placing ships on a grid and then taking turns to guess the location of each other's ships.

### Board Class

-   **Attributes:**

    -   `board_size`: Size of the board

    -   `num_ships`: Number of ships on the board

    -   `name`: Name of the player or "Computer"

    -   `type`: Type of board ("player" or "computer")

    -   `guesses`: List of tuples representing guessed coordinates

    -   `ships`: List of tuples representing ship coordinates

-   **Methods:**

    -   `__init__(self, board_size, num_ships, name, board_type)`: Initializes the board with the given size, number of ships, name, and type.

    -   `display(self, hide_ships=False)`: Displays the board. If `hide_ships` is True, ships are hidden.

    -   `process_guess(self, x, y)`: Processes a guess and returns whether it's a hit, miss, or repeat.

    -   `add_ship(self, x, y)`: Adds a ship to the board at the specified coordinates.

### Global Scores

-   **Dictionary:**

    -   `scores = {"computer": 0, "player": 0}`

### Helper Functions
----------------

-   `random_point(board_size)`: Returns a random integer between 0 and `board_size - 1`.

-   `valid_coordinates(x, y, board)`: Checks if coordinates are valid and not already occupied.

-   `populate_board(board)`: Places ships randomly on the board.

-   `populate_board_player(board)`: Allows the player to manually place ships on the board.

-   `get_player_guess(board)`: Gets the player's guess input.

-   `get_computer_guess(board)`: Generates a random guess for the computer.

-   `take_turn(board, guess_func)`: Handles a single turn for either player or computer.

-   `play_game(computer_board, player_board)`: Alternates turns between player and computer until the game ends.

-   `new_game()`: Initializes and starts a new game.

### Game Flow
---------

### Initialization

-   Input: Board size, number of ships, player name

-   Create `Board` instances for the computer and player

### Setup Phase

-   Player manually places ships

-   Computer places ships randomly

### Gameplay Phase

-   Alternate turns between player and computer

-   Handle guesses and process hits/misses

-   Update scores

-   Display updated boards and summary

### Endgame

-   Declare the winner based on remaining ships

-   Display final scores

### Relationships
-------------

-   `new_game()` creates `Board` objects and calls `populate_board` or `populate_board_player`.

-   `play_game()` uses helper functions like `get_player_guess`, `get_computer_guess`, and `take_turn`.
  

## Features

1. Manual placement of ships by player.

2. Random board generation for computer and player cannot see where the computer's ships are.

3. Accepts user inputs and gives saummary of scores after each round

4. Input validation for 
- Numbers out of board's range
- Check whether inputs are numbers
- Checks whether the same coordinates are given more than once

## Testing

The portal has been well tested and the results can be viewed [here - TESTING](https://github.com/yohannes2025/project3/blob/main/TEST.md)

## Technologies Used

The main technology used to create this program is Python

### Resources

- Visual Studio Code
- GitHub 
- Heroku


### Accessibility
- Keyboard-only interaction ensures the game is accessible for users with visual impairments when paired with screen readers.
- Clear and concise text-based instructions.


### Frameworks, Libraries & Programs Used
1. Python Standard Library
2. Heroku for deployment to the server.
3. PEP8 Python Validator for Python Code Validation.




## Future Updates

## Validation
1. Syntax Validation
    Result: The code executes without syntax errors.
   
2. Linter Warnings/Errors (PEP 8 Validation)
   E501: Line Too Long:
    Lines exceed the recommended 79 characters. These have been flagged, and corrections have been applied by splitting lines appropriately.
   
3. Functional Validation
Result: The game logic functions as expected.
    Player Input:
        Validated correctly (e.g., invalid formats are rejected).
        Correct handling of edge cases (e.g., out-of-bounds coordinates).
   
4. Integration Validation
Result: The program runs end-to-end without crashes or critical errors:
    A player can complete a game session from start to finish.
    Errors are gracefully handled with appropriate messages to the user.



## Deployment

### Heroku

The Application has been deployed from GitHub to Heroku by following the steps:

1. Create or log in to your account at heroku.com
2. Create a new app, add a unique app name ( for example corri-construction-p3) and then choose your region
3. Click on create app
4. Go to "Settings"
5. Under Config Vars add the private API key information using key 'CRED' and into the value area copy the API key information added to the .json file.  Also add a key 'PORT' and value '8000'.
6. Add required buildpacks (further dependencies). For this project, set it up so Python will be on top and Node.js on bottom
7. Go to "Deploy" and select "GitHub" in "Deployment method"
8. To connect Heroku app to your Github repository code enter your repository name, click 'Search' and then 'Connect' when it shows below.
9.  Choose the branch you want to build your app from
10. If preferred, click on "Enable Automatic Deploys", which keeps the app up to date with your GitHub repository
11. Wait for the app to build. Once ready you will see the “App was successfully deployed” message and a 'View' button to take you to your deployed link.

### Branching the GitHub Repository using GitHub Desktop and Visual Studio Code
1. Go to the GitHub repository.
2. Click on the branch button in the left hand side under the repository name.
3. Give your branch a name.
4. Go to the CODE area on the right and select "Open with GitHub Desktop".
5. You will be asked if you want to clone the repository - say yes.
6. GitHub desktop will suggest what to do next - select Open code using Visual Studio Code.
   
The deployed project live link is [HERE](https://heroku.com/) - ***Use Ctrl (Cmd) and click to open in a new window.***
