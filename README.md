# ULTIMATE Battleships
Battleships, also known simply as Battleship, is a classic two-player strategy game that blends deduction, tactics, and a touch of luck. Originating as a pencil-and-paper game during World War I, it has since evolved into a popular board game, digital adaptation, and mobile app enjoyed by players of all ages worldwide.

## Game Overview

In this Battleships, the player commands a fleet of ships strategically placed on a grid. The objective is to locate and "sink" the opponent’s fleet, in this case, the computer by guessing it's ships positions through a series of targeted strikes. The game involves strategic thinking as player must conceal his/her ships placement while trying to discover and destroy his/her opponent’s.

## Why should you play the battleship game?
Battleships is more than just a game-it's a test of strategy, anticipation, and patience. Its simplicity makes it accessible, while its depth keeps players coming back for more. Whether played on paper, a game board, or digitally, it remains an enduring favorite in family game nights and competitive play.

Are you ready to command your fleet and outmaneuver your opponent? Let the battle begin!

## Pre development


### Development

Code was written for each part of the program starting with the header and input for contractors to add their name. Once each section was working the development of the following section took place. Once all sections had been created testing took place which highlighted the need for additional features.

i.e.
In the "input name" section the user could hit enter and a blank space would be inputted so the first and last names were made required fields. Instructions were written to ensure each user understood the importance of entering their name only. After testing with required fields, the inability to add symbols and numbers was also added.

![CCCCP name error](/assets/images/cc-rm-name-error.png)

In the "input dates and hours" section testing highlighted the fact that a customer can enter that they worked for just one day but worked 36 hours. Additional coding was added to ensure the maximum number of hours worked in a day was 13 and that applied whether a user worked one day or 10.


## Features

1. Manual placement of ships by player.
   
![manual placement](assets/images/ship_placement.png)

3. Random board generation for computer and player cannot see where the computer's ships are.
   
![Random board](assets/images/random_board.png)

5. Accepts user inputs and gives saummary of scores after each round
   
![Round score](assets/images/round_score.png)

7. Input validation for
   
- Numbers out fo board's range
- Check whether inputs are numbers
- Checks whether the same coordinates are given more than once
  
![Input validation](assets/images/input_validation.png)




### What the portal checks


A name is inputted and not left blank. Instructions are given to only use letters to avoid a delay in payment.

![CCCCP name](/assets/images/cc-rm-name-error.png)


Profession is chosen from a list of options

![CCCCP professions](/assets/images/cc-rm-profession.png)

The dates (must be within a two month period), the total number of days and hours worked.

![incorrect dates](/assets/images/cc-rm-incorrect-dates.png)


As per Working Time Regulations 1998 a maximum of 13 hours are allowed in a day. App checks that less than 13 hours is inputted per day.

![CCCCP hours](/assets/images/cc-rm-13.png)

Hours can not exceed the dates.


Based on information provided a calculation is made to determine pay before tax and then pay after tax and NI deductions.


![CCCCP confirm](/assets/images/cc-rm-check-information-ok.png)

The program checks that the contractor is ready to submit this information. 

If they select yes, they receive confirmation of submission

![CCCCP submission](/assets/images/cc-rm-information-submitted.png)

If they select no, they are invited to re-submit, as shown above.

### Error Page

A 404 error page has been included. The html was run through the W3C html validator and errors removed. A css style file was created to support the display of the text on the page.


## Google Sheets

Using Google sheets wasn't part of the original project spec and was added after all the code was created, tested and working. The sheet contains two sections

### Payments
In this area the following contractor information is included:

- First name
- Last name
- Profession
- Start date
- End date
- Pay before tax

![gsheet](assets/images/gsheet-rm-ccccp.png)

### Tax
In this area the following contractor information is included:

- First name
- Last name
- Profession
- Pay before tax
- Tax to pay
- National Insurance to pay

![gsheet](assets/images/gsheet2-rm-ccccp.png)

This information is sent to the umbrella company.

## Testing

The portal has been well tested and the results can be viewed [here - TESTING](https://github.com/todiane/corri-construction-p3/blob/main/TESTING.md)


## Future Updates

The next update of the app will include the option to choose whether it is their first visit (which will show the instructions) or whether they have used the service before - which will show the instructions behind a button.

The ability for a manager to log into the system and confirm working dates and days for each contractor all in one place rather than via separate emails.

Relevant information is accessible by the umbrella company so that HR doesn't have to collate and forward this information.

Other future updates are included in the TESTING.md file.

## Validation

PEP8 - Python style guide checker imported - https://pypi.org/project/pep8/
All code validated and where lines were showing as too long they were adjusted. Some line adjustments caused bugs in the code and it stopped working so they were left as longer lines to avoid this issue. pycodestyle . - was used in Codeanywhere terminal to list any issues.

## Bugs

After importing the type element so that text can be typed out a line at a time the codes for Fore.WHITE or bold kept showing up e.g. '\033[1m' for bold was typed out. To fix this I had to remove - colorama.init(autoreset=True) - which  meant I had to go through each line of code to ensure if one line was red, all subsequent lines didn't turn red.

## User Experience (UX)

### Initial Discussion
The Battleship Game is a text-based interactive experience where the player competes against a computer. The primary goal is to create an engaging yet straightforward gameplay experience while maintaining functionality and usability.

### User Stories
1. As a user, I want a clear and intuitive grid-based board for gameplay.
2. As a user, I want responsive feedback on my actions (e.g., hits and misses).
3. As a user, I want a seamless flow of turns and easy-to-understand instructions.
4. As a user, I want to track scores and understand the outcome of the game.

## Design

### Colour Scheme
Since this is a text-based game, the visual elements focus on ASCII characters. 
- Symbols like `.` for empty spaces, `@` for ships, `X` for hits, and `O` for misses provide clarity.

### Typography
- Monospaced fonts are ideal for aligning the grid structure.

### Imagery
- No images are used; ASCII characters ensure cross-platform compatibility.

### Wireframes
- Text-based representation of the game board and turn prompts.

## Features

1. Manual placement of ships by player.
   
![manual placement](assets/images/ship_placement.png)

2. Random board generation for computer and player cannot see where the computer's ships are.
   
![Random board](assets/images/random_board.png)

3. Accepts user inputs and gives saummary of scores after each round

4. Input validation for 
- Numbers out fo board's range
- Check whether inputs are numbers
- Checks whether the same coordinates are given more than once
  
![Input validation](assets/images/input_validation.png)


## Key Features
1. Strategic Placement: Players must carefully position their ships to maximize defense while minimizing predictability.
2. Deductive Reasoning: Every missed or successful shot brings new information, challenging players to think critically and outwit their opponent.
3. Simple Yet Engaging: The rules are straightforward, but the gameplay offers endless strategic depth and replayability.

### Accessibility
- Keyboard-only interaction ensures the game is accessible for users with visual impairments when paired with screen readers.
- Clear and concise text-based instructions.
